# Code-Exercises

### Purpose:
Using [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) to complete coding challenges.
Hoping to use for:

* JavaScript
* Python
* C#
* Java
* C++

It has problem sets for over 45 languages, highly reccomend it to learn a new language quickly, or master futher concepts in one you may already have expereince in.

All exercises come with a readme and a test suite so that every completion is done with TDD in mind.
